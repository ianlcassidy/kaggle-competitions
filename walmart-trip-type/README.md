# walmart-trip-type

This repo contains my iPython notebook for the "Walmart Recruiting: Trip Type Classification" competition.  I came in ~200th place out of over 1000 entrants, but only spent about a week on the competition.  More grid searching over hyperparameters would have increased my leaderboard score.
