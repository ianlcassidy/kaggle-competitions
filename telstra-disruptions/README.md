# telstra-disruptions

This repo contains my iPython notebook for the "Telstra Network Disruption" competition.  I came in ~470th place out of over 1000 entrants, but only worked on the competition for about a week.  Feature engineering seemed to be the primary driver of better scores in this competition.
